# ðŸ’¡ Overview

CryptKeeper is a browser extension for managing zero-knowledge identities. It securely separates ZK identity and ZK proof generation from the application layer. Specifically, it manages identities created using the [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) protocol and allows proof generation from [RLN](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/) and Semaphore.

&#x20;This plugin is still in development and uses the [zk-kit library](https://github.com/appliedzkp/zk-kit).
